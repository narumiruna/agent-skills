description: Switch a clean Git worktree to local `main` and fast-forward it from its configured upstream without losing branches, commits, or local files. Use only when the user explicitly invokes $syncing-main-branch or names syncing-main-branch.

# Syncing Main Branch

Use only after explicit invocation. Operate on the current repository and preserve the branch, commits, and files being left.

## Workflow

1. Inspect tracked and untracked state, branch, and HEAD:

```bash
git status --porcelain=v1 --untracked-files=all
git status --short --branch
git symbolic-ref --quiet --short HEAD
```

Stop on any local change; do not stash, commit, discard, or carry it automatically. If HEAD is detached, record it and inspect containing refs. Stop until an otherwise reflog-only commit is preserved with a user-chosen branch or tag.

2. Resolve `main` exactly.
   - Use local `refs/heads/main` when it exists.
   - If absent, create tracking `main` only when exactly one intended remote `main` is clear: `git switch --no-overwrite-ignore --track -c main <remote>/main`.
   - Stop if the remote is ambiguous, `main` does not exist, or another worktree owns it. Do not substitute another branch or bypass worktree protection.

3. Switch with ignored-file overwrite protection when needed:

```bash
git switch --no-overwrite-ignore main
```

4. Verify `main` tracks the intended upstream, fetch its configured remote, then fast-forward only:

```bash
upstream_remote=$(git config --get branch.main.remote)
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref 'main@{upstream}'
git fetch "$upstream_remote"
git merge --ff-only --no-overwrite-ignore 'main@{upstream}'
```

Stop on missing or unexpected upstream, authentication failure, divergence, ignored-file collision, or non-fast-forward. Do not rebase, reset, force, delete files, change upstream, or delete the previous branch.

5. Verify `git status --short --branch` and `git log -1 --oneline --decorate`. Report the active branch, before/after object IDs, upstream, and whether it advanced. “Already up to date” is success and requires no commit.
