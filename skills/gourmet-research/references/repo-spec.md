# Gourmet Repo Spec (Minimal)

## City Folder
Path: `gourmet/<city-slug>/`

## Required Files (6)
- `overview.md` - context, strategy, progress checklist
- `inbox.md` - raw capture, to be triaged
- `candidates.md` - structured table of all candidates
- `notes.md` - evidence + scoring rationale
- `top-places.md` - final recommendations + dining strategy
- `excluded.md` - audit trail for rejected places

## Output Language Rule
If user preference is unknown, ask once at project start and record it in `overview.md`.

## Preservation Rule
Never delete candidate rows. Mark `rejected` and document in `excluded.md`.
