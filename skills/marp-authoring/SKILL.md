# Marp Authoring Entry

## Overview
Thin entry skill for Marp/Marpit authoring. Core principle: route directly to the authoring references instead of skimming the full slide-creator bundle.

## When to Use
- Writing Marp/Marpit slides (syntax, directives, layouts)
- Looking for theme features or authoring best practices
- You already have colors and no SVG diagram work

## Quick Reference
| Goal | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Syntax & directives | references/syntax-guide.md |
| Layout patterns | references/patterns.md |
| Complex layouts | references/advanced-layouts.md |
| Themes | references/themes.md |
| QA checklist | references/best-practices.md |

## Example
Prompt: "Need a split layout with a code block." → Read `syntax-guide.md`, then `advanced-layouts.md`.

## Assets
- `assets/templates/` - Starter Marp templates
- `assets/examples/` - Slide examples and patterns
- `assets/icons/` - Common slide icons

## Common Mistakes
- Skimming slide-creator overview instead of authoring references
- Opening color or SVG modules for authoring-only tasks

## Red Flags
- "I'll just skim everything first"
- "Maybe the SVG rules are part of authoring"
